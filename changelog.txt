- 3 new pelt patterns
- 2 new pelt colours, peach not completed
- 13 new tortie masks based on pelt patterns
- 17 new eye colours
- Reworking of eyes in general. Newborns will have their eye colour labelled as "???", while kittens typically have paler eyes that (typically) are labelled as "kitten-(colour)" before growing into their true eye colour. Eye_colour is now for the right eye and eye_colour2 is for left, regardless of heterochromia. heterochromia is no longer limited to completely different colours and can instead be very, very similar tones
- 2 new permanent conditions (which will affect the cat's appearance in the future)
- 7 new base tints, 7 new white patch tints. for the most part these are copying from one to the other.
- New shader
- Hidden 'toxicity' relationship value, which is tracked by the game and affects other relationship values, can be affected by mediators, can have moon events. you know that guy you dont really dislike but you start losing HP the longer youre around them? yeah
- It / its default pronouns
