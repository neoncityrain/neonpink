Newborns will have their eye colour labelled as "???", while kittens typically have paler eyes that (typically) are labelled as "kitten-(colour)" before growing into their true eye colour. Eye_colour is now for the right eye and eye_colour2 is for left, regardless of heterochromia. heterochromia is no longer limited to completely different colours and can instead be very, very similar tones
